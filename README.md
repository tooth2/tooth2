<!--
**tooth2/tooth2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Computer Vision, Deep learning (CNN, RNN/LSTM, GAN, etc) and Natural Language Processing with Python, C++, and JAVA.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Autonomous car driving - Lidar sensor fusion, Point cloud, Localization , Path planning and  so on
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
